# Helm Charts

![Release Charts](https://github.com/rm3l/helm-charts/workflows/Release%20Charts/badge.svg)

Collection of some tools and apps that I maintain, ready to launch on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) using [Helm](https://helm.sh/).

## TL;DR

```bash
$ # Add Helm Chart Repo
$ helm repo add rm3l https://helm-charts.rm3l.org

$ # Search repo
$ helm search repo rm3l

$ # Install a given Chart as a Release
$ helm install my-release rm3l/<chart>
```
